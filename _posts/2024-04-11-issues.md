# Issues with Dev Containers

I am currently trying to setup a deep learning container to complete part of my assignment. I am encountering issues with selecting a kernel within Jupyter. I have verified that the dev container is working by running a generic python file. However, when I try to select a kernel within the Jupyter notebook, no kernels show up. To make things even more confusing, the kernels show up when selecting which ones to filter out. I am able to get a kernel selected on the frozen-cpu branch of the course22 repository however, as soon as I switch to frozen-gpu or gpu branches, the dev container builds successfully but I am unable to select a kernel to execute the notebook.
