# Hello World!

Join me on my journey through The University of Queensland's ELEC4630 - Computer Vision and Deep Learning! 

This is my first ever blog post and it was super simple to do. I followed the guide created by fast.ai which can be found [here](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2020-01-16-fast_template.html). I am super excited to share what I have learnt and any challenges I have faced! See you soon.
